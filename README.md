# server-init
Server initialization, install basic packages, setup basic security stuff and
create _ansible_ user.

This role can be run both as `root` and as any other sudoer.  
This will only disable the `root` login if it can connect as a sudoer.

## Requirements
Role created for Ubuntu 16.04 amd64 and armhf.  
**become** is required to run this role.

## Role Variables
### Mandatory
```yaml
# Use this to generate init_user_password_crypted:
# mkpasswd -m sha-512 'PASSWORD'

init_hostname:
init_user_login:
init_user_password_crypted:
init_user_pubkey:  # "ssh-rsa (â€¦)"
```

### Optional
```yaml
# boolean, should we disable ufw ipv6 support, this is needed on some armhf hosts.
init_disable_ufw_ipv6:

# Ports en open, eg.:
init_ufw_open:
  - to_port: 80
    proto: "tcp"

# Files to write, eg.:
init_files:
  - content="foo"
    dest="/bar"
    owner="root"
    group="root"
    mode="0600"
```

## Dependencies
None.

## Example Playbook
Don't become on the whole play but on the role. If you become on the whole play
you'll be root when the fact gathering occurs.
This prevents the role from removing password-authenticated remote root access
as we don't do it if `ansible_user_id` is root (to avoid locking ourselves
out).

This also means the role should be run at least twice, once as root to create
the `ansible` user and once as `ansible` to remove root access.

```yaml
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - {role: "L-P.server-init", become: true}
```
